## About

I am a **geospatial scientist** working at the intersection of GIS, remote sensing, and deep‑learning computer vision. I advocate and contribute to open-source software - Xarray, QGIS, STAC, GeoPython stack to name a few.


## Experience

**[GalaxEye Space](https://www.galaxeye.space/)** | Geospatial Scientist | Sept 2023 – present

**[Blue Sky Analytics](https://blueskyhq.io/)** | Data Scientist | May 2022 – Sept 2023

**[Satyukt Analytics](https://satyukt.com/)** | Remote Sensing Engineer | Sept 2021 – Mar 2022

**[Rotten Grapes Pvt. Ltd](https://rottengrapes.tech/)** | Web GIS Developer | Feb 2021 – May 2021



**Past work, current focus and interests:**

- **Computer vision**: deep learning for segmentation and object detection; current focus on *self‑supervised learning*.
- **Sensors and data**: SAR and optical VHR data with spatial resolution down to 0.5 m apart from open‑source datasets; experience with datasets from Umbra, Capella, Maxar, SkySat, ICEYE, and Synspective.
- **MLOps**: **DVC** and **MLflow**; designed and deployed end‑to‑end experiment tracking, data versioning, and reproducible training/inference pipelines in production.
- **Performance**: GPU optimization and profiling; Python packaging and environment management for reliable builds.
- **Workflows**: **STAC** experience including operating a STAC API server.
- **Tooling**: developed **QGIS** plugins; built an active‑learning pipeline using a **Random Forest** predictor and **QGIS** as the labeling tool.

I co‑founded **[Let's Talk Spatial](https://letstalkspatial.in)**, a community for geospatial enthusiasts, hosting events and collaborating with other communities like OpenStreetMap Bengaluru and IEEE GRSS Bangalore chapter. I actively contribute to open‑source projects and share my knowledge through blogs, videos, and workshops.

As the *Young Professional Chair* of **IEEE GRSS Bangalore** chapter, I co‑organize [various events](https://site.ieee.org/bangalore-grss/events_list/student-yp-events/).

I've spoken at open‑source conferences like **[FOSS4G Kosovo](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSeJLsP3KYyuuChdOiRBY-bkmiO2e5-_z)** and **[FOSS4G Asia Seoul](https://github.com/amanbagrecha/Foss4gAsia2023)**, sharing my insights on open‑source technologies. 

My publications can be found on **[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h0CeG6AAAAAJ)**.




I graduated from **[Rashtreeya Vidyalaya College of Engineering](https://www.rvce.edu.in/)** in Civil Engineering where I was the president of the **[ASCE Student Chapter](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7voXITBJ16)**, leading the team to the **[Concrete Canoe Competition](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3kDEZ9Bb--/)** among various other activities. During college, I was also a Research Intern at the **Indian Institute of Science**, working on *non‑stationary rainfall intensity surface drainage design*.

Beyond work, I enjoy jogging and playing badminton.
