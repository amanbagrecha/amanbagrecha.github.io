## About

I am a geospatial scientist specializing in GIS, AI/ML, and Remote Sensing. I advocate and contribute to open-source software - Xarray, QGIS, STAC, GeoPython stack to name a few. Beyond my professional life, I enjoy jogging and playing badminton.

I graduated from [Rashtreeya Vidyalaya College of Engineering](https://www.rvce.edu.in/) in Civil Engineering where I was the president of [ASCE Student Chapter](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7voXITBJ16), leading the team to [Concrete Canoe Competition](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3kDEZ9Bb--/) among various other activities.
During college, I was also a Research Intern at Indian Institute of Science working on [non-stationary rainfall intensity surface drainage design](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1573062X.2023.2287049).

I co-founded [Let's Talk Spatial](https://letstalkspatial.in), a community for geospatial enthusiasts, hosting events and collaborating with other communities like OpenStreetMap Bengaluru and IEEE GRSS Bangalore chapter. I actively contribute to open-source projects and share my knowledge through blogs, videos, and workshops.

As the Young Professional Chair of IEEE GRSS Bangalore chapter, I co-organize [various events](https://site.ieee.org/bangalore-grss/events_list/student-yp-events/). I'm also an [OSGeo Charter member](https://www.osgeo.org/member/bagrecha/) since November 2023.

I've spoken at opensource conferences like [FOSS4G Kosovo](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSeJLsP3KYyuuChdOiRBY-bkmiO2e5-_z) and [FOSS4G Asia Seoul](https://github.com/amanbagrecha/Foss4gAsia2023), sharing my insights on open-source technologies. 

My publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h0CeG6AAAAAJ).
