This library allows us to crawl STAC catalog and enables rapid access to the metadata we need.\n\n```python\n# STAC API root URL\n# Thanks to element84 for hosting the API for sentinel-2 catalog.\nURL = 'https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v0/'\n\nclient = Client.open(URL)\n\nsearch = client.search(\n    max_items = 10,\n    collections = \"sentinel-s2-l2a-cogs\",\n    bbox = gdf.total_bounds, # geodataframe for our region of study\n    datetime = '2022-01-01/2022-01-24'\n)\n```\nIn the above code, we search for 10 sentinel-s2-l2a-cogs over our AOI for the date between January 1 and 24 of 2022.\n\nNow we need to know which of our 10 queried images covers our area of interest in its entirety. To do that, we can plot all the search results on the map and visually inspect.\n\n\n<figure>\n\n![bokeh_plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76432265/183255939-121e585e-79dc-4ceb-b61e-7e08709de926.png)\n\n<figcaption align = \"center\"><b><i>Fig.2 -\nSentinel-2 tiles overlaid on Region of Interest</ href> </i></b></figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n\n\nWe see that our AOI is not covered by a single tile in entirety, and that there is a need to merge adjacent tiles.\n\n\n> Note that we have so far only queried the metadata of our desired imagery\n\nWe use rasterio's [merge](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.merge.html) functionality, which would enable us to combine all of them seamlessly.\n\nFirst, we get all the tiles for a single day and look for True Color Image (TCI) band\n\n```sh\n# retrieve the items as dictionaries, rather than Item objects\nitems = list(search.items_as_dicts())\n# convert found items to a GeoDataFrame\nitems_gdf = items_to_geodataframe(items)\n\ntiles_single_day = items_gdf.loc['2022-01-23', \"assets.visual.href\"]\n\n# print(tiles_single_day)\n properties.datetime\n 2022-01-23 05:25:14+00:00    https://sentinel-cogs.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.c...\n 2022-01-23 05:25:11+00:00    https://sentinel-cogs.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.c...\n 2022-01-23 05:24:59+00:00    https://sentinel-cogs.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.c...\n 2022-01-23 05:24:56+00:00    https://sentinel-cogs.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.c...\n Name: assets.visual.href, dtype: object\n\n```\n\n\nNext, read the remote files via the URL in the above output using `rasterio.open` and save the returned file handlers as a list. This is the first instance where we are dealing with the actual imagery. Although, we are not reading the values stored in the data just yet.\n\n```py\n# open images stored on s3\nfile_handler = [rasterio.open(row) for row in tiles_single_day]\n```\n\nFinally we can merge all of the tiles and get the clipped raster stored in memory. \n\n```py\nfrom rasterio.io import MemoryFile\nfrom rasterio.merge import merge\n\nmemfile = MemoryFile()\n\nmerge(datasets=file_handler, # list of dataset objects opened in 'r' mode\n    bounds=tuple(gdf.set_crs(\"EPSG:4326\").to_crs(file_handler[0].crs).total_bounds), # tuple\n    nodata=None, # float\n    dtype='uint16', # dtype\n    resampling=Resampling.nearest,\n    method='first', # strategy to combine overlapping rasters\n    dst_path=memfile.name, # str or PathLike to save raster\n    dst_kwds={'blockysize':512, 'blockxsize':512} # Dictionary\n  )\n```\n\nThere are really interesting things to look at in the above code. Overall, the code above returns a `MemoryFile` object which contains a `uint16` raster with bounds of our AOI and blocksize of 512. The attribute `dst_path` allows us to specify a path to save the output as a raster. What is interesting is we can not only pass a file path to save on local disk but also a virtual path and save the merged raster **in-memory**, avoiding clutter of additional files on disk.\n\nTo define a virtual path, we use rasterio's `MemoryFile` class. When we create a `MemoryFile` object, it has a `name` attribute which gives us a virtual path, thus treating it as a real file (using GDALs [vsimem](https://gdal.org/user/virtual_file_systems.html#vsimem-in-memory-files) internally). This MemoryFile object (`memfile` here) provides us all the methods and attributes of rasterio's file handler, which is extremely helpful.\n\n\n```py\nprint(memfile.open().profile)\n\n{'driver': 'GTiff', 'dtype': 'uint16', 'nodata': 0.0, 'width': 4110, 'height': 3211, 'count': 3, 'crs': CRS.from_epsg(32643), 'transform': Affine(10.0, 0.0, 788693.4700669964,\n       0.0, -10.0, 1500674.3670768766), 'blockxsize': 512, 'blockysize': 512, 'tiled': True, 'compress': 'deflate', 'interleave': 'pixel'}\n\n```\n\nThe `method='first'` tells us the strategy used to determine the value of the pixel where the rasters overlap. In this case, the pixel value from the first imagery of the overlapping region in the list, is used as the value for the output raster.\n\nThe entire algorithm to merge rasters is illustrated in the figure below by taking an example of combining two rasters with `method=first`.\n\n<figure>\n\n![merge-rasterio-with-laberl_merging-rasters](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76432265/183279200-05b96cd5-f0a7-48e0-9b37-480792756d16.jpg)\n\n<figcaption align = \"center\"><b><i>Fig.3 -\nInternal working of rasterio's merge functionality. src1 and src2 are two overlapping raster.</ href> </i></b></figcaption>\n\n\n</figure>\n\nFrom the above figure, for each raster in the list:\n- it finds the intersection with the **Output Bounds** (named `region` in the figure)\n\n- next, it gets a boolean mask of invaild pixel over the `region` (named `region_mask` in the figure). \n\n\n- next, it copies over all the existing values from the raster for the `region` to an array (named `temp` in the figure)\n\n- It gets a boolean mask for the valid pixels in the `temp` array. (named `temp_mask` in the figure)\n\n- With these four arrays, it runs the `method=first`, which is to\n  - create the same shaped array as that of `region` and fill values with negation of `region_mask` (named `A` in the figure)\n  - create a filter by combining `region_mask` and `A` with a AND gate (named `B` in the figure)\n  - copy over the values from `temp` to `region` using `B` as the filter\n\nThese series of steps are performed for all the rasters in the list. Finally, the output at the end of each iteration is combined to produce `dest` raster. \n\n> Notice the dark strip bands for each array which represents the overlapping region. Also notice that values from the dark strip in step **`1`** did not change at the end of step **`2`** \n\n---\n\n\n### Custom combining strategy for overlapping regions\n\n\nWe can have arbitrary conditions on how to combine the overlapping region. By default rasterio uses values of the first overlapping raster from the list of Input files as pixel values for the output raster file. It has several other options in its utility such as `min`, `max`, `sum`, `count`, `last`.\n\nTo define our custom method, say in this case, I want to take the average of all the pixel values over my overlapping region and copy them to the output file. To do that, we can override the method by defining our custom method. Let us see how —\n\nWe take a look at the source code of built-in methods which make use of two or more rasters to make decisions on the output pixel values. Few such methods which do that are `copy_sum`, `copy_min`, `copy_max`, `copy_count`.\n\n\nLooking at the [copy_min](https://github.com/rasterio/rasterio/blob/main/rasterio/merge.py#L40) from source code, we see that it performs two logical operations each before and after the custom logic we wish to apply.\n\n\n<figure>\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76432265/183279064-f2437364-b4bd-4761-8b99-2aa3bc65bc42.png)\n\n<figcaption align = \"center\"><b><i>Fig.4 -\ncopy_min function copies minimum value from overlapping region to the output raster</ href> </i></b></figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n\n\nWe would replace our custom logic of averaging with that of `minimum` in the above code and that is all there is to it. We can now use this function to manipulate the values of overlapping region!\n\n```py\ndef custom_method_avg(merged_data, new_data, merged_mask, new_mask, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Returns the average value pixel.\"\"\"\n    mask = np.empty_like(merged_mask, dtype=\"bool\")\n    np.logical_or(merged_mask, new_mask, out=mask)\n    np.logical_not(mask, out=mask)\n    np.nanmean([merged_data, new_data], axis=0, out=merged_data, where=mask)\n    np.logical_not(new_mask, out=mask)\n    np.logical_and(merged_mask, mask, out=mask)\n    np.copyto(merged_data, new_data, where=mask, casting=\"unsafe\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Endnote\n\nThe modern approach to merge rasters in python is to only stream the data for your region of interest, process and perform analysis on the raster in memory. This would save you a huge cost and time. This is possible because of [COGs](https://www.cogeo.org/) and [STAC](https://stacspec.org/en).\n\nWe looked at the merge method in depth and also explored the techniques used to combine the overlapping data. Finally, we created a custom method for merging rasters by modifying the existing code to suit our requirements.
