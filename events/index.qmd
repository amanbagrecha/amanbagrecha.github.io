## December 2023

Attended (and organised) InGARSS 2023, which happened in IIIT Bangalore. I was the YP Chair - helping organize 2 events.

I took year end break and went on vacation. This year was by far the most I've travelled. Wish to do the same this year (maybe even more)!

## November 2023
Attended FOSS4G Asia in Seoul - co-conducted workshop on [GeoPython](https://github.com/Rotten-Grapes-Pvt-Ltd/geopython-workshop) and also gave a talk on [Sentinel-1 Image Analysis Flood detection using cloud native tooling](https://github.com/amanbagrecha/Foss4gAsia2023). South Korea was a experience to be lived. It was chilly outside, but I had good company throughout. Found Indian food luckily :)

We also had our [13th meetup](https://twitter.com/letstalkspatial/status/1725733833688129980) at Indian Institute of Human Settlements in collaboration with OpenStreetMap Bengaluru - to talk about OSM and iD editor. The presenters also showcased map making using QGIS.

Our paper [Climate responsive design for road surface drainage systems: a case study for city of Bengaluru](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1573062X.2023.2287049) got accepted in Urban water Journal!



## October 2023

I conducted [workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUMjcau7JAs) on Planetary Computer and STAC API which was also the 12th meetup conducted by Let's Talk Spatial. 

I attended [Geosmart Conference](https://geosmartindia.net/2023/index.php) in Hyderabad. A lot of geospatial companies were present. Made many new connections and got to know about latest trends and how the indian geospatial community is up to. 


## September 2023
